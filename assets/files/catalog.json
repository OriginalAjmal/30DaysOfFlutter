The charging could be faster and Touch ID would be nice, but overall this is a beast that can't be beat. The iPhone 13 Pro Max nails practically every aspect of what makes a smartphone great. This premium flagship (from $1,099) packs a 120Hz refresh rate display, the fastest performance of any handset and epic battery life.",

The Pixel 6 Pro is a powerful and capable phone and Tensor, while somewhat moderate in benchmarks, has some seriously excellent applications. You get a lot with the Pixel 6 Pro. For $899, you get a large 120Hz display, triple rear cameras and a new Tensor chipset, which together make it the bargain rival of phones that cost hundreds more.",

It delivers top-notch performance, over 14 hours of battery life and a bright and colorful display all in a delightfully portable design. The MacBook Air M2 feels truly worthy of the Air name. And I'm not saying that the previous MacBook Air M1 wasn't good. It's just that cramming revolutionary performance in the same old chassis didn't feel like a leap forward to me.",

Sure it's design is polarizing and the amount of available storage space isn't huge given the large size of games these days. But with killer haptics from the DualSense controller, immersive 3D audio, and a fast SSD with an expansion slot that's now unlocked for upgrades, the PS5 feels like a truly next-generation games console now",

Priced at a premium $249, you get a lot for your money versus the regular AirPods, including powerful ANC, a customizable fit and sweat- and water-resistance. The design is still bit weird-looking, but Apple has shortened the stems on these earbuds while adding useful gesture controls. Apple crammed in three microphones, a powerful audio driver that feel like magic.",

For starters, the S Pen is more responsive, as Samsung made it 70% faster with less latency. The display is also brighter and more colorful than anything we've tested.",
